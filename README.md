**Set up a virtual environment** (Optional)

   It's recommended to create a virtual environment to keep the dependencies required by this project separate from your system's Python environment. Here's how you can create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   On Windows:

   ```bash
   .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On Unix or MacOS:

   ```ls
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
