**Set up a virtual environment** (Optional)

   It's recommended to create a virtual environment to keep the dependencies required by this project separate from your system's Python environment. Here's how you can create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   On Windows:

   ```bash
   .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On Unix or MacOS:

   ```ls
   source env/bin/activate
   ```


**Install the dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
**Run the project**

   Now you can run the project easily by click on the run all button in the jupyter notebook

   **Things to note**
   Tensorflow might not support all python's version, I strongly suggest you guys to use python 9 - python 11 version.
